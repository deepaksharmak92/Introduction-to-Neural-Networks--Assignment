# Introduction-to-Neural-Networks--Assignment
In this assignment, you will build a complete neural network using Numpy. You will implement all the steps required to build a network - feedforward, loss computation, backpropagation, weight updates etc.

Problem Statement-
In this assignment, you will build a complete neural network using Numpy. You will implement all the steps required to build a network - feedforward, loss computation, backpropagation, weight updates etc.

You have been provided with some starter code in the notebook below, you have to write the remaining part to create a full-fledged neural network. You only have to write code in cells marked '#Graded'  at places where '# write your code here'  is mentioned.

You will use the MNIST dataset to train your model to classify handwritten digits between 0-9.

The assignment is divided into the following sections:

Data preparation
Feedforward
Loss computation
Backpropagation
Parameter updates
Model training and predictions
 

Let's start with a lecture in which Prof. Raghavan introduces the assignment and explains how the data has been prepared.
